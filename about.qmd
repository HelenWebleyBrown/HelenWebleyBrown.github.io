## About

I am a Research Officer at LSE's [Phelan United States Centre](https://www.lse.ac.uk/united-states). At LSE, I work on several projects within Prof. Lauren Sukin's program of research entitled *Dangerous Divisions: The Impact of Polarization on Nuclear Politics.* The projects examine how domestic political conditions in the US impact its international standing. Alongside this role, I am a Research Assistant for Prof. Helen Margetts at the [Oxford Internet Institute](https://www.oii.ox.ac.uk/), focusing on digital information exchange between the UK government and its citizens. I am also an affiliate of the [Center for American Political Studies](https://caps.gov.harvard.edu/) at Harvard University.

Before returning to London in late 2024, I spent six years studying in the US. I moved across the pond for undergrad via the US-UK Fulbright Commission's wonderful [Sutton Trust US Programme](https://us.suttontrust.com/). In 2022, I graduated from Washington University in St. Louis with an A.B. in Political Science. In 2025, I mastered out of MIT Political Science's Ph.D. program, earning an S.M. in Political Science. I reapplied to Ph.D. programs that same year and will (re)start my doctoral training at Stanford Sociology this fall as a [CCSRE Emerging Scholar](https://ccsre.stanford.edu/programs/ccsre-emerging-scholars).
