## About

I am a first-year sociology PhD student at Stanford University. I am also a Stanford [CCSRE Emerging Scholar](https://ccsre.stanford.edu/programs/ccsre-emerging-scholars) and an affiliate of the [Center for American Political Studies](https://caps.gov.harvard.edu/) at Harvard University. Substantively, I research topics related to surveillance tech, local political institutions, and racial inequality. Methodologically, I use quantitative methods to tackle both descriptive and causal questions, often leveraging large administrative datasets and survey experiments.

Although my research focuses on the US, I was born and raised in London, England. I have lived in the US for the past seven years and first moved across the pond for undergrad via the US-UK Fulbright Commission's wonderful [Sutton Trust US Programme](https://us.suttontrust.com/). In 2022, I graduated from Washington University in St. Louis with an A.B. in Political Science. In 2025, I mastered out of MIT's Political Science Ph.D. program, earning an S.M. in Political Science. I reapplied to Ph.D. programs that same year. 

In between leaving MIT and (re)starting my doctoral training at Stanford, I was a Research Officer at LSE's [Phelan United States Centre](https://www.lse.ac.uk/united-states) and a Research Assistant at the [Oxford Internet Institute](https://www.oii.ox.ac.uk/).
