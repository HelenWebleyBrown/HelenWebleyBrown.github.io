    "text": "There’s a hidden curriculum that structures much of academic life. Unfortunately, knowing what to do, how to do it, and who to ask for help isn’t intuitive. You’re less likely to “be in the know” if you don’t have family members with Ph.Ds or if you belong to groups that have been traditionally underrepresented/historically excluded in academia. If you’re not “in the know,” you can lose out on various funding, mentorship, and learning opportunities. If you’re “in the know,” it might be hard to see what remains hidden for others or the advantages that played a role in how you came to know.\n“I don’t even know what I don’t know” has been a constant thought reverberating in my head throughout grad school. When I first started my Ph.D. (the first time around), I felt like I’d jumped out of a plane and been told to build a parachute on the way down. This challenge was exciting and the learning curve—while steep—was transformative. But, I started to look around and see that some people had been given a high quality parachute before they jumped out the plane… and they seemed to think less of me for not having mine already built. Whenever I pointed this out to faculty, I’d get a response like “Skydiving is supposed to be hard,” “Building a parachute is intuitive. It’s your job to build it on your own,” or “Are you sure this is about peoples’ parachutes? Maybe you just shouldn’t have jumped,” or “Maybe we don’t have many skydivers like you because they just don’t enjoy building parachutes as much.” None of this sounded quite right to me, but I didn’t know what to make of my experience. It took me a while to understand that: 1) the problem was the parachute policy, not me, and 2) building a parachute is easier when there are others around who have built/are currently building their own, and are willing to help you with yours.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEven though I’ve been through two application cycles now and have some graduate training under my belt, there’s still a ton of things I don’t know, but I’m always happy to talk with people who are considering applying to graduate school or already in a program (and maybe even considering leaving one like I did).\nOn this page, I’ve shared two types of resources. First, I’ve shared my previous application materials from the two cycles I went through (political science Ph.D. programs in 2021/22 and then a mix of political science and sociology Ph.D. programs in 2024/25).

    "text": "Conference Papers\nGupta, A., Wu, V., Webley-Brown, H., King, J., Ho, D. (2023). The Privacy-Bias Tradeoff: Data Minimization and Racial Disparity Assessments in U.S. Government. In Proceedings of the 2023 ACM Conference on Fairness, Accountability, and Transparency (FAccT ’23).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n   Abstract\n\n\n\n\n\nAn emerging concern in algorithmic fairness is the tension with privacy interests. Data minimization can restrict access to protected attributes, such as race and ethnicity, for bias assessment and mitigation. Less recognized is that for nearly 50 years, the federal government has been engaged in a large-scale experiment in data minimization, limiting (a) data sharing across federal agencies under the Privacy Act of 1974, and (b) data collection under the Paperwork Reduction Act. We document how this “privacy-bias tradeoff” has become an important battleground for fairness assessments in the U.S. government and provides rich lessons for resolving these tradeoffs. President Biden’s 2021 racial justice Executive Order 13,985 mandated that federal agencies conduct equity impact assessments (e.g., for racial disparities) of federal programs. We conduct a comprehensive assessment across high-volume claims agencies that affect many individuals, as well as all agencies filing “equity action plans,” with three findings. First, there is broad agreement in principle that equity impact assessments are important, with few parties raising privacy challenges in theory and many agencies proposing substantial efforts. Second, in practice, major agencies do not collect and may be affirmatively prohibited under the Privacy Act from linking demographic information. This has led to pathological results: until 2022, for instance, the US Dept. of Agriculture imputed race by “visual observation” when race information was not collected. Data minimization has meant that even where agencies want to acquire demographic information in principle, the legal, data infrastructure, and bureaucratic hurdles are severe. Third, we derive policy implications to address these barriers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n   Recognition\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBest Paper Award – FAccT 2023\n\nStudent Paper Award – Privacy Papers for Policymakers (PPPM) by the Future of Privacy Forum\n\n\n\n\n pdf  Policy Brief  In The Wild"
