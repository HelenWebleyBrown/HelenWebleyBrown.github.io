Hello -- my name is **Helen Webley-Brown**. I am a __Research Officer__ at __LSE__'s Phelan United States Centre and a __Research Assistant__ at the __Oxford Internet Institute__. In fall 2025, I'll begin my Ph.D. in Sociology at Stanford University.

You can read more about my academic journey on my [about](about.qmd) page and [teaching](teaching.qmd) page. 

If the ideas on my [research](research.qmd) page interest you, please feel free to reach out to talk more about them or explore possible collaborations. 

I'm also always happy to talk with people who are considering applying to graduate school and have shared my previous application materials on my [resources](resources.qmd) page alongside some suggested reading materials on navigating academia.
