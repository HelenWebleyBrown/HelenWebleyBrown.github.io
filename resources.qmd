## Overview

There's a hidden curriculum that structures much of academic life. Unfortunately, knowing what to do, how to do it, and who to ask for help isn't intuitive. You're less likely to "be in the know" if you don't have family members with Ph.Ds or if you belong to groups that have been traditionally underrepresented/historically excluded in academia. If you're not "in the know," you can lose out on various funding, mentorship, and learning opportunities. If you're "in the know," it might be hard to see what remains hidden for others or the advantages that played a role in how you came to know. 

"I don't even know what I don't know" has been a constant thought reverberating in my head throughout grad school. When I first started my Ph.D. (the first time around), I felt like I'd jumped out of a plane and been told to build a parachute on the way down. This challenge was exciting and the learning curve---while steep---was transformative. But, I started to look around and see that some people had been given a high quality parachute before they jumped out the plane... and they seemed to think less of me for not having mine already built. Whenever I pointed this out to faculty, I'd get a response like "Skydiving is supposed to be hard," "Building a parachute is intuitive. It's your job to build it on your own," or  "Are you sure this is about peoples' parachutes? Maybe you just shouldn't have jumped," or "Maybe we don't have many skydivers like you because they just don't enjoy building parachutes as much." None of this sounded quite right to me, but I didn't know what to make of my experience. It took me a while to understand that: 1) the problem was the parachute policy, not me, and 2) building a parachute is easier when there are others around who have built/are currently building their own, and are willing to help you with yours.

Even though I've been through two application cycles now and have some graduate training under my belt, there's still a ton of things I don't know, but I'm always happy to talk with people who are considering applying to graduate school or already in a program (and maybe even considering leaving one like I did). 

On this page, I've shared two types of resources. First, I've shared my previous application materials from the two cycles I went through (political science Ph.D. programs in 2021/22 and then a mix of political science and sociology Ph.D. programs in 2024/25). Second, I've put together some suggested reading lists featuring several scholars' insights into navigating academia, including several that discuss the unique challenges that are faced by those with marginalized identities. These resources have helped me along the way and I hope they prove helpful to others.

## Application Materials

__2021/22 Cycle: Ph.D. in Political Science at MIT__

In the 2021/22 cycle, I applied to 13 Ph.D. programs: 1 in information science, 7 political science, 3 in public policy, and 2 joint political science with policy. I received 6 acceptances (1 infosci, 1 public policy, 1 joint polisci/policy, 3 polisci) and 1 waitlist. Here are my materials for the offer I accepted, but please shoot me an email if you want to see what I wrote for one of the other disciplines.

<a href="papers/SOP-MIT.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="bi-file-earmark-pdf-fill btn btn-primary" role="button"> Statement of Purpose</a>

__2024/25 Cycle: Ph.D. in Sociology at Stanford__

In the 2024/25 cycle, I applied to 14 Ph.D. programs: 6 political science and 8 sociology. I received 8 acceptances (4 polisci and 4 sociology). Here are my materials for the offer I accepted, but please shoot me an email if you want to see what I wrote for one of the other disciplines. 

Note that these are structured a little different than "normal," because I had to explain why I was leaving a Ph.D. program and why I wanted to switch disciplines.

## Reading Suggestions

In each of these boxes, I've listed some readings that either helped me make sense of my negative experiences during grad school or provided me with insights into some aspect of the hidden curriculum. If you get stuck behind an article paywall, let me know and I'll try to send a link.

Note: If you are an author listed here and would like to be removed---or an author not listed here and would like to be added---please feel free to shoot me an email!
